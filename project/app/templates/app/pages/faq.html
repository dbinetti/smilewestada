      <h5>
        Who are you?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        We're a group of West Ada School District parents, teachers, and staff who want to make masks optional this year.  The site was created by David Binetti, a parent in the West Ada School District.

      <h5>
        Why this year?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        First, because it's practical: if something happens we don't need to worry about closing the schools because they will be closing already for the summer.  Second, we don't want the first issue of the new Superintendent to be dealing with "the mask issue" at the start of the school year.  Finally, we owe it to our graduating Seniors to end their tenure seeing the smiles of their classmates.

      <h5>
        I heard the administration was considering this already -- why not wait for their plan?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        We're glad that the adminstiration is being proactive but change -- even for the better -- is always difficult.  We want to influence and support their decision as much as possible.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class='my-2'>
      <h5>
        But if we make masks optional aren't we taking a risk?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        Yes, of course -- but that won't change in the Fall.  Or in 2022.  Or ever.  There will never be a risk-free time; there is only a best time, and that time is this year.
      </p>

      <h5>
        What are you doing with my personal information?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        If you join us we'll add you to the private list of supporters which we report on as an aggregate total.  Then, you'll also get the opportunity to make your name public, which we'll report directly along with any (respectful) comments you'd like to share.  Finally, we'll present these reports to the West Ada School Board so that they can see the breadth of support to make masks optional.

      <h5>
        Who is paying for this?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        This is entirely self-funded.  It isn't a business, and we're not even asking for donations.  We just want to see the kids smiles, and that's worth more to us than the few dollars it takes to run this website.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class='my-2'>
      <h5>
        Why fully optional?  Why not just outdoors-only?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        Outdoors is great, but eventually if we're going to have masks optional in the classroom we need to do that now, when there is no risk of unexpected closure since the schools are closing for the summer already.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class='my-2'>
      <h5>
        What about the new strain of Covid going around?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        There will always be a new strain of something going around, so unless we intend to make masks a permanent part of school then we should make them optional now, when the timing is best.
      </p>

    <div class='my-2'>
      <h5>
        Shouldn't we listen to the experts?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        Of course!  We're listening to the medical experts, and the mental-health experts, and the academic experts, and the cognitive development experts and every other expert we can.  We want all those opinions so we can make a balanced decision; focusing only on one issue (ie, single-factor analysis) means you can't make informed decisions by-definition.

      <p>
        To participate, you agree to be:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resolute</strong> in advocating our position, and
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Respectful</strong> both online and offline to those who disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our movement is focused solely on advocacy for our narrow objective; there is no financial purpose nor is their a broader agenda.  Once we accomplish our mission, the service will be shut down completely and all data deleted entirely.

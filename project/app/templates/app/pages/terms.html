      <p>
        To participate, you agree to our Code of Conduct, which starts with being:
      </p>
      <div class='ml-5'>
        <p>
          <strong>Respectful</strong> both online and offline, and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Resolute</strong> in advocating our position.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p class='mt-5'>
        In practice, this means:
      </p>
      <ul class='list-styled'>
        <li>We support our opposition's right to be heard.</li>
        <li>We follow the rules, even as we work to change them.</li>
        <li>We reject threats of any kind, even electoral ones.</li>
        <li>We support our teachers.</li>
        <li>We do not force our views on unsympatehtic ears.</li>
        <li>We believe that masks' benefits are far outweighed by their costs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Good people can disagree on important issues.  We are never guaranteed to get what we want, nor that the process will be entirely fair.  We do not expect everyone to agree with this approach, but do believe it is the surest path to success with this Board.

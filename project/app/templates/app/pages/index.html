            On Tuesday February 9th, the West Ada School Board voted 4-1 to bring the kids all in school, Full-Time, In-Person, K-12 by March 29 (moved up from the original date of April 13.)
          </p>
          <p>
            While this fell short of our original goal of March 1, I believe we helped shift the conversation to, as Trustee Chair Amy Johnson put it, "not whether we are coming back to school, but how much sooner we can move it forward."  I firmly believe that we played an important part in making that happen, and while the result might not be perfect, it certainly was very, very good.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the coming days, as promised, I will delete any and all personal information and close down the site entirely.  Look for one final email from me immediately before that happens.  But for now, let me simply say thank you.  Thank you for helping get our <strong>Smile West Ada</strong>.
          </p>

Thank you for standing up for our kids!

Our initial reaction has been tremendous, with more than 150 members joining our
movement over the weekend!  These are really good numbers to start, but we are
going to need more to ensure our eventual success.

To that end, we're holding a planning session over Zoom tonight, Monday May 3,
at 8PM Mountain Time.  The goal is to brainstorm ideas, discuss strategy and
coordinate efforts so that we can speak with one, clear powerful voice at the
Board Meeting on May 11.

Please join us!  It's open to anyone who wants to do more to support our
efforts. That said, please know that I run a very tight meeting -- we will start
on time, stay on task, and finish within the hour -- so please be comfortable
with that if you choose to participate.  Here's the meeting info:

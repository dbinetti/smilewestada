Thank you for being a part of Smile West Ada!

I'm writing because I need to be more stringent in enforcing
the "real full name" policy on the website.  This has always
been a requirement, but now that we're really gaining serious
traction it's more important than ever to stress the authenticity
of our movement.

What this means for you:

- I've made your account private.  This means that your name
and comments (if any) will no longer appear on the homepage.
- All information is saved!  Nothing has been or will be
deleted.
- If you wish to have your name and comments reinstated, simply
provide your real, full name and re-check the "Make My Name
Public" box.  Everything will instantly appear back on the homepage.

I'm sorry that I have to burden you with this inconvenience;
thanks for your understanding.

If you have any other questions please don't hesitate to reach
out to be at this email or by phone at 415.713.2126

Best, Dave

Thank you for being willing to speak at the May 11th Board Meeting
on behalf of Smile West Ada.

The comment period is being restricted, so there won't be time for
everyone to speak.  As a result, we're coordinating all of our
comments so that we aren't being redundent and can cover all of
our arguments in favor of masks optional.

I can't promise a speaking spot on behalf of Smile West Ada to everyone
because of this constraint, but thanks for being willing; even if we
can't all speak in person I will have an alternative so that everyone
can be heard.

I'll follow up before Monday as I see who is interested in serving
in this role.  In the meantime, please simply accept my thanks for
standing up for our kids!

Best, Dave

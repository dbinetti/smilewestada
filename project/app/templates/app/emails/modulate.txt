Thank you for being a part of Smile West Ada!

I'm writing because I need to be more stringent in enforcing
the "repspectul, on topic" policy on the website.  This has always
been a requirement, but now that we're really gaining serious
traction our opposition will soon start to enter the "fight"
mode, which means they will use any inconsistency against us.

What this means for you:

- I've hidden your comment on the homepage.
- All information is saved!  Nothing has been or will be
deleted.
- If you wish to have your comments reinstated, please edit them
to stay respectful and specifically on topic to the issue of making
masks optional the last two weeks of the year in West Ada.
Everything will instantly appear back on the homepage.

I know this is subjective, but  but the value we hold over our
opposition comes from the focused nature of our movement.  As we get
closer to the Tuesday Board Meeting we'll need every advantage to
prevail; thanks for understanding the importance of this.

If you have any other questions please don't hesitate to reach
out to be at this email or by phone at 415.713.2126

Best, Dave

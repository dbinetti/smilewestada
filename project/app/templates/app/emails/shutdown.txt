Shutdown Notice

*Summary*
The Smile West Ada site is shutting down and deleting all collected data.  No action
is required.  This will be the last message you receive.  Thank you!


*Detail*
On Tuesday February 9th, the West Ada School Board voted 4-1 to bring
the kids all in school, Full-Time, In-Person, K-12 by March 29 (moved up from
the original date of April 13.)

While this fell short of our original goal of March 1, I believe we helped shift
the conversation to, as Trustee Chair Amy Johnson put it, "not whether we are
coming back to school, but how much sooner we can move it forward."  I firmly
believe that we played an important part in making that happen, and while the
result might not be perfect, it certainly was very, very good.

Since our purpose is now moot, as promised I'll be shutting down the site and
deleting any and all personal information collected, effective immediately.  If
you'd like to reach me in the future for any reason, you can do so at
dbinetti@gmail.com or 415.713.2126.

Before this is complete, I wanted to let you know about a new site I've created
called "Help West Ada", the goal of which is to help connect parent volunteers
with needed roles at the District (such as substitute teachers.)  The details of
this are still in flux, but if you'd like to sign up to learn more please do so
at https://www.helpwestada.com .  Same rules as before: it's free, private, and
you can delete your info at any time.

Finally, **Thank You** for taking a stand for our kids.  We're getting the Kids
All In full time at the end of the month, and you made that happen.  Thank you
so much.

Best, Dave

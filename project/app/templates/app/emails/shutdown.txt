Smile West Ada Shutdown Notice

*Summary*
- Smile West Ada has shutdown.
- All collected data has been deleted.
- Consider joining the West Ada Parents Association at:
    https://www.westadaparents.com.


*Detail*
On Tuesday June 15, the West Ada School Board voted 5-0 to
make masks optional for the 2021-2022 school year.

Now that we've accomplished our mission, as promised the site has been shut
down and all personal information collected has been deleted, effective
immediately.  This is the last email you'll receive.

If you wish to stay active in District affairs, I wanted to let you
know about a new organization I've created: the West Ada Parents
Association.  Our goal is to support the District in avoiding any
controversial policies that might distract from providing our students
with a quality education.  If you'd like to sign up or learn more
please do so at:

    https://www.westadaparents.com

Same rules as before: it's free, private, and you can delete your
info at any time.

Finally, **Thank You** for getting involved.  We're going to see the
smiles next year, and you made that happen.  Thank you so much.

Best, Dave

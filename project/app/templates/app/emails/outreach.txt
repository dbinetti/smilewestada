**UPDATE**

My email provider overwrote the links in the original message with overly long strings.  This follow-up email should be easier to follow and forward -- it is otherwise identical to what I sent before.  Apologies for the double-send.

My friend, this will likely be my one and only email to you.

**Final Push**
Tonight I'll be speaking at the Board meeting in favor of getting
the Smile West Ada -- Full-Time, In-Person, K-12 by March 1. As of last count we
represent more than 250 parents, and while that is *amazing*, we still have a
few hours left to increase our numbers.

Please reach out to someone you know who isn't already a part of our movement.
Here is some sample text:

"
Friend, I'm not sure where you stand on getting the kids back in school
full-time k-12, but I've joined a group of parents who are asking the board to
get the kids all in by March 1.  It's important we get as many parents as
possible to join us to support the Board and give them to confidence to bring
our kids back.

The Board meeting is tonight, so please do so right now if you can.

**Met with District**
Please know that our efforts are working! I reached out to
the District and spent yesterday afternoon with Superintendent Ranells,
Assistant Superindentdent Heller, and the two chairs of the Middle and High
School committees. They gave our position a fair and full hearing, and
understand why we believe March 1 represents getting our kids in safely as soon
as possible.

In the end, Mr. Heller pledged to present our data if asked by the Board, which
will undoubtedly happen. Now many of you are unwilling to take this on faith; I
know there is a history here to which I'm not party. But I have only been
treated directly and honestly, and until and unless that changes I will respond
in kind.  Please give this some consideration.

**Support our Teachers** As you may know, the teacher's union came out against
the District's plan. So not only do they not want March 1, they don't want April
13 either. In fact, if the vaccine isn't what they're waiting for it isn't
obvious that they will ever accept coming back at all.

Still, the union is not the teachers! We love our teachers, even those with whom
we disagree, so please show them the respect they deserve. While the FDA and CDC
may support returning to full-time instruction, fear is a powerful force, and
we've been living with that fear for more than a year.

If possible, show your support for the teachers by sharing this video:

**Call for Volunteers**
Lastly, the District needs support: substitutes, bus drivers,
para-educators. Operationally all of this is a challenge. In the coming days
I'll add a form to specifically call for volunteers, but in the meantime if you
wish please just send me a note to dbinetti@smilewestada.com if you're in a
position to help.


In closing, thank you for being all-in for the kids. Together, we can get the
kids all in.

Best,

Dave

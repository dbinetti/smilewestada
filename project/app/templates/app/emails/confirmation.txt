Thank you for joining Smile West Ada!

We've registered your support to make masks optional the final two
weeks of the school year.  Your backing means we can speak at the next
Board Meeting on May 11th in one clear, powerful voice.

If you haven't already, please consider forwarding this link to other
parents because the more support we have the more likely we'll
succeed:

If you have any other questions please don't hesitate to reach out
either at this email, or call/text me at 415.713.2126.

Let's see those smiles, West Ada!

Best, Dave

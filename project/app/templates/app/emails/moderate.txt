Thank you for being a part of Smile West Ada!

I'm writing because I need to be more stringent in enforcing
the "repspectul, on-topic" policy on the website.  This has always
been a requirement, but now that we're really gaining serious
traction it's more important than ever that we stay focused.

What this means for you:

- I've hidden your comment on the homepage.
- All information is saved!  Nothing has been or will be
deleted.
- If you wish to have your comments reinstated, please edit them
to stay respectful and specifically on topic to the issue of making
masks optional the last two weeks of the year in West Ada.
Everything will instantly appear back on the homepage.

Here are some things that tend to lead to moderation:

- Political topics outside of masking.
- Anything related to vaccines or vaccination.
- Threats or other overly confrontational comments towards Board Members.
- Invectives on teachers or the teacher's union.
- Anything that is deliberatively provocative.

I know this is all subjective, but the value we hold over our
opposition comes from the focused, reasonable nature of our movement and
I need to ensure that remains the case for as long as possible.

If you have any other questions please don't hesitate to reach
out to be at this email or by phone at 415.713.2126.

Best, Dave

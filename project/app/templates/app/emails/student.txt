{{first|title}},

My name is David Binetti and I started the Smile West Ada movement to
make masks optional the last two weeks of the school year.  Your comment
on the site was moving, and I really think the School Board Trustees
need to hear directly from you.

Would you be willing to speak tonight at the Board Meeting?

I'm reaching out to you and a few other students who made similarly
powerful remarks.  It's just two minutes, and would make a huge difference.
We have a few slots reserved and can make it easy.

If you would consider this, please speak with your parents -- do not respond
to me without speaking with them first.  I had to reach out to you directly
since I have no other contact information, but again it's very important
that your parents know about this.  You can forward this message to them.

If you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them either in email or
on the phone, but again that request will need to come from your parents.

Thank you so much.

Dave
